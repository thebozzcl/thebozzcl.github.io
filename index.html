            Very Early Thanksgiving Reflection of 2020
          </a>
        </h3><p>There‚Äôs this habit I developed sometime after I moved away from Chile.</p>

<p>One cold October night, I was feeling a little stressed because of work, so I 
went for a drive. I stopped at a park overlooking Elliot Bay. It was dark enough
that I couldn‚Äôt really see the water, but I could hear the waves and feel the
breeze. I sat down, and I let my thoughts go wherever they wanted. What was I
doing with my life? Was I really happy with my choices so far, with the sacrifices 
I made? Had it all been worth it?</p>

<p>At some point, it hit me that what I was doing much better than I was making it
seem. I had made sacrifices, yes, but I grew a lot as a result. I was still feeling
a little lonely, but I had a lot of support from my friends and family back home,
and I was starting to build a group of friends here in Seattle. I realized that,
even though I was going through hard times in that instant, I had a lot to be thankful
for.</p>

<p>I decided to write that down and share it, and that became the very first ‚ÄúVery
Early Thanksgiving Reflection‚Äù, and I‚Äôve tried to keep it up every year since.
Given the current circumstances, I think this year‚Äôs reflection is going to be
more important than ever. I‚Äôm putting extra time and thought into it. It‚Äôs also
Canadian Thanksgiving, so it‚Äôs perfect timing, in a way!</p>

        </h3><p>Global outbreaks have a way to make you feel powerless. Sitting at home, waiting for the coronavirus to blow over‚Ä¶ is there really nothing else you can do? Well, there are ways in which you can help. One such example is <a href="https://foldingathome.org/">Folding@Home</a>. F@H is an initiative that uses your computer‚Äôs resources to help simulate how proteins and other complex chemicals work. They have set up <a href="https://foldingathome.org/2020/02/27/foldinghome-takes-up-the-fight-against-covid-19-2019-ncov/">high-priority jobs to analyze the 2019-nCoV virus</a>, in hopes to help find antibody targets.</p>

<p>If you want to help, it‚Äôs as easy as <a href="https://foldingathome.org/start-folding/">downloading and running their program</a>. Well‚Ä¶ except for the life of me I couldn‚Äôt get it to run in Ubuntu. So I decided to find a way to do so.</p>
