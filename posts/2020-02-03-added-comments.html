    <p>It‚Äôs been a busy week, between going back to work and my other personal project (expect posts about it soon!). I still found some time to get some work on my blog done, and now I have comments enabled! I‚Äôm gonna go on and blabber about the process, as usual.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>When writing this blog, I stick to three design principles:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Keep it light and simple</li>
  <li>Keep it cheap</li>
  <li>Do cool stuff anyway</li>
</ul>

<p>From the start, I knew comments would complicate things a bit. You need to store comments somewhere! You need to save them, and load them and show them! That‚Äôs a load of stuff to do, it‚Äôs not simple! You can always use a third-party service for comments, but that‚Äôs not cheap! I decided to take some time and look at my options carefully. I ended choosing <a href="https://fastcomments.com/">FastComments</a>.</p>

<h2 id="so-why-fastcomments">So why FastComments?</h2>

<p>FastComment‚Äôs tagline is ‚ÄúAt 7.27 kB with no dependencies, it‚Äôs the fastest comment service around‚Äù. That covers the simple and light part. How about cheap? Well, their cheapest tier costs $5.00 with a load limit of ‚Äújust‚Äù 1 million page loads per month, so I‚Äôll manage. A self-hosted solution in the cloud might be cheaper, to be honest, but that‚Äôs more work than I‚Äôm willing to do. All in all, FastComments seemed worth a try.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-set-it-up">How to set it up</h2>

<p>After creating an account, setup is very easy: you just need to paste their code snippet into your site. I did it the Jekyll way and created a new include for comments, and then used that in the site layouts. Then I customized the snippet slightly:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">script</span> <span class="n">src</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"https://cdn.fastcomments.com/js/embed.min.js"</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="sr">/script&gt;
&lt;div id="fastcomments-widget"&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="n">div</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">script</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
  <span class="n">window</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="no">FastCommentsUI</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">getElementById</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'fastcomments-widget'</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="ss">tenantId: </span><span class="s2">"{{ site.fastcomments.tenantId }}"</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="ss">urlId: </span><span class="s2">"{{ site.url }}{{ page.permalink | post.permalink }}"</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="ss">commentCountFormat: </span><span class="s2">"[count] comments on {{ page.title | post.title }}"</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="ss">headerHTML: </span><span class="s2">"&lt;h1&gt;{{ site.data.translated_strings.leave_a_comment[site.active_lang] }}&lt;/h1&gt;"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="p">});</span>
<span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/script&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The first field, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tenantId</code>, is just the customer identifier.</p>

<p>FastComments uses the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">urlId</code> field to aggregate comments. If left unset, it defaults to the URL of the current page. Instead, I hard-coded the default language URL for the page so the comments section is shared across all languages!</p>

<p>The last two fields, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">commentCountFormat</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">headerHTML</code>, allow you to override some of the strings in the comments widget. I used this, plus the translation scheme I set up in <a href="/posts/2020-01-26-first-post.html">my previous post</a>, to partially translate it!</p>

<h2 id="thoughts-and-feature-wishlist">Thoughts and feature wishlist</h2>

<p>FastComments is a very new service, so it‚Äôs still a WIP. There‚Äôs a bunch of improvements I‚Äôd like to see:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Better localization or string overrides: <del>I talked to their support team, and they‚Äôre planning to improve this in the next few weeks.</del> <strong>UPDATE 02/08/2020</strong>: localization is now supported either by auto-detect or by passing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">locale</code> attribute to the widget. It supports <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">en_us</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">es_es</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fr_fr</code>, which should do for my purposes!</li>
  <li>Better documentation: I struggled to get things working my way a little bit because the documentation for the code snippet is lacking. I had to search through the FastComments blog to <a href="https://blog.fastcomments.com/(1-24-2020)-how-to-make-a-comment-system-like-hackaday.com.html">figure out the available arguments</a>. I‚Äôd prefer dedicated documentation.</li>
</ul>

<p>So while it‚Äôs pretty bare-bones right now, FastComments matches my design philosophy well and it‚Äôs very cheap. I can‚Äôt confirm them being the lightest or the fastest, but it‚Äôs more than good enough for what I wanted. I‚Äôm pretty happy so far, and I‚Äôm looking forward to what they offer in the future.</p>

<h2 id="runner-up-comments-system-can-you-do-comments-with-just-a-static-site-and-nothing-else">Runner-up comments system: can you do comments with just a static site and nothing else?</h2>

<p>You can! If we kept everything that way, the only way to add comments is by changing the code of my site. This is exactly what <a href="https://staticman.net/">Staticman</a> does: it pushes a change to the code repository for each comment. It‚Äôs such a delightfully odd solution, and it works pretty well! There‚Äôs a catch, though: it takes a while for comments to show up because the site needs to be rebuilt each time. I opted to keep the site responsive and do it some other way.</p>
